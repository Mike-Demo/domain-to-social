- Social lookup core lives in `src/lib/social/lookup.server.ts` (framework-agnostic `lookupDomain`); server fns are thin wrappers. Why: bulk lookups and an MCP server can reuse it later as premium entry points.
- Platform rules live only in `src/lib/social/platforms.ts`. Why: one registry drives extraction, search fallback, and UI.
- Fallback search uses DuckDuckGo HTML (no API key). Why: free/open for the MVP; swap behind `ddgSearch` if rate-limited.
- Tier 3 fallback = direct per-platform existence probes (`probe` in `platforms.ts`) on guessed handles, kept only when the profile links back, always unverified. Why: cheap, no 1000-site machinery.
- qeeqbox/social-analyzer is reference-only, never a dependency; if a probe library is ever needed, prefer MIT Sherlock. Why: AGPL-3.0 conflicts with a hosted premium service, and it pulls Firefox/Selenium/tesseract.
- Evidence strength is a computed label (strong/moderate/weak from counted signals via `rateEntry`), never a percentage. Why: honest, explainable confidence.
